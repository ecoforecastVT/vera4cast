    "description": "All forecasts for the Daily_Water_temperature variable for the inflow_gefsClimAED model. Information for the model is provided as follows: flow is forecasted as using a linear relationship between historical flow, month, and 5-day sum of precipitation.  Temperature is forecasted using a linear relationship between historical water temperature, month, and 5-day mean air temperature.  NOAA GEFS is then used to get the future values of 5-day sum precipitation and mean temperature.  Nutrients are forecasting using the DOY climatology.  The DOY climatology was developed using a linear interpolation of the historical samples..\n                                    The model predicts this variable at the following sites: tubr.\n                                    Forecasts are the raw forecasts that includes all ensemble members or distribution parameters. Due to the size of the raw forecasts, we recommend accessing the forecast summaries or scores to analyze forecasts (unless you need the individual ensemble members)",
